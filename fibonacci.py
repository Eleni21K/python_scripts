'''
Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers 
to generate and then generates them. Ask the user
to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the 
next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers
in the sequence. 
The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
